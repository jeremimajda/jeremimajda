👋 Hi there! I'm Jeremi Majda, a Junior Software Developer with a keen interest in data analysis, specializing in Python and Django. My journey includes a strong grasp of SQL databases, enhanced by my fascination with extracting insights from data.

📊 Alongside software development, I'm passionate about delving into the complexities of data, seeking to combine my programming skills with analytical prowess. This interest is complemented by my meticulous attention to detail, a trait sharpened by my law studies.

🌱 I'm committed to continuous learning and improvement, frequently diving into new technologies and coding practices. My journey has been enriched by teaching young minds about programming at Coding Giants, where I shared my knowledge in Scratch, Minecraft Education Edition, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.

🔍 I'm currently navigating the final year of my law degree while avidly expanding my IT expertise. I'm on a quest to find opportunities that challenge me and allow me to leverage my unique blend of legal precision and technical skills.
