👋 Hi there! I'm Jeremi Majda, a passionate Junior Software Developer with a focus on Python and Django. I embrace the power of SQL databases and enjoy dissecting complex documentation, thanks to my meticulous attention to detail honed through law studies.

🌱 I'm committed to continuous learning and improvement, frequently diving into new technologies and coding practices. My journey has been enriched by teaching young minds about programming at Giganci Programowania, where I shared my knowledge in Scratch, Minecraft Education Edition, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.

🔍 I'm currently navigating the final year of my law degree while avidly expanding my IT expertise. I'm on a quest to find opportunities that challenge me and allow me to leverage my unique blend of legal precision and technical skills.

📫 Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me here on GitHub!
