- 👋 Hi, I’m @jeremimajda
- 👀 I would love to work as a Python developer, so I'm learning Python, SQL, HTML, CSS and everything that comes in handy 😉 
- 🛠 To be honest, I don't know what will be best for me yet, so I'm open to learning new languages and new tools.
- ⏱ The first time I thought about a programming career was in mid-2021, but I started studying regularly in August 2022. 
- 💻 I study at home with Udemy courses, YouTube tutorials and helpful articles I can find on the Internet.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build apps with Django.
