- 👋 Hi, I’m @jeremimajda
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, so I learn python, html, css and anything that comes in handy 😉 
- 🛠 To be honest, I don't know what will be best for me yet, so I'm open to learning new languages and new tools.
- ⏱ The first time I started thinking about a career as a programmer was in mid-2021, but I started studying regularly in September 2022. 
- 💻 I study at home using Angela Yu's Udemy courses, You tube, any tutorials and articles I can find on the web.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build apps with Flask.
